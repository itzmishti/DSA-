So i am crarung a carpool app CommuteX for internal jpmc employees, we don have jpmc shuttles but they have logins times with 1.5 hr gap and in bangalore traffic it take a lot of time in crowd some higher Vp and all and some other peeps dont eben use shuttles for comute so our ap is for all users in case you miss ashuttle or you would have to like different opions forlogin for flaexiblity or you prefer to go by car so in case you miss shuttle usually there is always a surge in prices and most autos andf cabs dont eveb excpt ride in traffic ,so it cound be a subsidised option of paying about 50-60 ruppes intesd of 200-250 ruppes for one way auto , for the drives who arr going with empty car they can earn andd extra cash of about 60-240 ruppes per ride depending upon the seats and distance so benificial for both also helps reduce carvn emission, has posirive socila imapct by pairing people, we can also hae 3. he "Reserved Return" (Guaranteed Morning-to-Evening Lock)
The Wow: When a user books a ride to work in the morning, the app doesn't just find a ride to the office. It creates a "Return Pact."

The Logic: The app pairs two people who live near each other and have similar "Tentative Departure" times in their calendars. If they both stick to the pact, they both get a "Loyalty Bonus.",this reduces parking demands as well 

please give me a 3-4 slide deck crisp with actaully winning points like shark tank 

include problem,solution,benifits,feasiblity in deck with graphs
