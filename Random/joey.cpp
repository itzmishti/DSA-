 Just a quick, quick announcement. We have another 10 minutes, so we just wanted to kind of keep track of time as well. In these last 10 minutes, this is also time for those probably who haven't had the chance to speak. So let's also be reduce the conversation and fitators, you can capture the summary and start what's out of this conversation.. using we could. We will summarise the. she did the ident. d textdown for each of. Afterwards. C. So that, right, water comperence is water. be able to see what is a form yourization. I don't know what the design is. but either it's a database very., you can between Google forms, you can do a lot of things in Google Microsoft has micforms and use some on Google document this month. Whoever is is your source of truth for any of this particular. Like, I have one question. I'm sorry to interrupt. What is a confidentiality of the issue here? If you are using AI? Confidentiality, how we can ensure the solentiality. Then in he is always confident. For example, you have other. Okay. It's a very confirmation.. We take for identification. So on those numbers, even though it is in data, it has to be gripted and. Okay. Even if I'm developers and I should not have that like you said, 40,000 would have submitted some ideas., yes. It is not possible for me to download this 40,000 and other numbers and others. That is what is called data breach.. You see all over the news, it get access to hundreds of numbers. That happens because someone data. sold the data, which is a trust here. which is being saved in a database of by your to be included in the so nobody gets. conjections you are making, it has to be a secureaction, like HPS. Don't deploy your sides on the city because you are prone to the attacks. Yes. can use a skill injections. to excite the d because I think all the hackers know that all the enginees doesn't spend too much in and governance his man to companies they know literally cannot. What do they do if they target site is HTTP and by looking at the form of data they do SKI objections. So what is with them whichPS. And you can try Can we have to go with that, you know? Otherwise it is a dark web,id as in the cybersecurity. Yeah. traffic.. Whatever data you sending, easily visible for. Like, we are having lighthouse app, okay, because since we are working with the G, so always the IS officer is very keen how the data is confident. Okay, so now we are using dashboard. Last year, like we used, like we are implementing now 12 states. So majority of the officers asking, what is Ash? Yes, yes, yes. This is one of that the Okay.. agree to this So we say encryption.. you, no? Yes. Okay, that is one part. In.. So in the data need to get inserted into your form or data. Like for everybody, you give me an answer. As soon as you save your data with my name, going into the cl Even some of the BB was the supporting kind of. So it comes as an functionalends on the data stores you are choosing.. There are certain options to even win history also, you can do thation, right. But do any other, like, Google form is safe, they say. Here are see like, if I want to analyse the data, other than Google form, CGP also helps, okay But that is not safe on the side. It's not safe to AI, right? Arrive with some sampling, not at... Yes, yes. is there other, like Google form many other websites or this thing where we can safely safely do the analysis because we also get a lot of huge data. just wrap up their catalogue. Okay now you have these data. Some confidential, normal. Nam, the data catalogue, you cannot run analysis confidential. Oh,. Okay. That is what I'm. Okay. And now the field which are not at all important, like, state, city, student, grade, college, what the. This is what I run my analytics. I will never run my analytics.. during data question we need to get rid of having items for you, only five days of it might be a. Because of those five get rid of other would probably actually be this encrypted data doesn't require AD, I have a good question, so people say that to get success, we must get dated. So, as a program manager, what I need to concentrate one is, I want to. So, historical data is like gold? What data you are going to get in the future? Nobody in this table can answer. historical data you have, right? You need to make sense, make sense of the world what do that need be a manager. and you're looking at some of this topic.onserv catalogue.. What can I, what I can make of this? How is the data use for this? is an important question? You have to answer yourself looking at the data. for example, you said we aresh. Now, two three set might not be performing very well. So how do you find out? as a pling is very important for you to know? those two states and you need to spend more effort. people on the states
