Perfect 👍 — let’s go through this **step by step, conceptually**, without touching any code.

You’ve already finished the first part (creating the `notify_to` column), so now you need to understand what exactly happens next — what the “updation queries and logic” mean, and what the flow will look like end to end.

---

## 🧩 The Purpose of This Entire Task

Your system currently sends **notification emails** based on some internal logic — maybe using a utility function or a predefined rule to decide *who* should receive an email (for example: a user, a city admin, or a vendor).

But up to now, **this logic was hardcoded**. The system itself was deciding whom to notify, without any configuration stored in the database.

Now, you’ve introduced a **new database column called `notify_to`**, whose job is to *store that configuration* — that is, who should be notified for a particular email template or workflow.

From now on, instead of relying only on hardcoded logic, the application can **read from this column** to know who should receive an email.

---

## 🏗️ The Overall Flow

Here’s how the whole setup is designed to work:

1. **You have existing email templates** (or some configuration table) in the database.
2. Each template corresponds to a particular workflow — for example:

   * “User creation”
   * “Vendor approval”
   * “City registration”
     Each of these already has an internal logic deciding who should get the email.
3. You’ve added a new column `notify_to` in that same table.
4. Now, you have to:

   * Populate this new column for all existing templates (using update queries).
   * Update your service so that whenever a template is created or updated, this field also gets saved.
   * Ensure this value flows correctly between backend and frontend.

## 🧭 Understanding the “Notify To” Concept

“Notify To” represents the **recipients** of the email notification.
In your system, there are **three recipient types**:

1. **User**
2. **City**
3. **Vendor**

Since multiple recipients can be notified for a single event, the field will store **comma-separated numbers**, where each number corresponds to a recipient type.

For example:

| Notify To Value | Meaning                     |
| --------------- | --------------------------- |
| `1`             | User only                   |
| `2`             | City only                   |
| `3`             | Vendor only                 |
| `1,2`           | Both User and City          |
| `1,3`           | User and Vendor             |
| `1,2,3`         | All three receive the email |

To make this clear and standardized across the system, constants are defined:

* User → `1`
* City → `2`
* Vendor → `3`

## 🧮 What the Update Queries Are For

When you added this column, all existing records (templates) in the database are now missing this value — it’s currently empty or null.

So your next task is to **fill this column** for existing templates.

You’ll do this by looking at the **current email workflow logic** that already decides who receives emails for each event.
For example:

* For “User Registration” templates → currently, the system sends the email to the *User* → so `notify_to = 1`.
* For “Vendor Approval” → it notifies *City Admin* and *Vendor* → so `notify_to = 2,3`.
* For “City Report” → it notifies *City Admin* only → so `notify_to = 2`.

So, your **update queries** will populate `notify_to` values for all templates, according to this mapping.
In simple words, you’re syncing the new column with the logic that already exists.

---

## 🔄 The Role of the Utility (Util) Class

The conversation mentioned a “util” — this refers to an internal utility that currently decides **who receives the email**.

You’ll need to look at that util to:

* Identify which types of recipients are used for which template or scenario.
* Use that information to decide what `notify_to` values should be stored for existing templates.

After that, you can finalize how many “update queries” you need (one for each template type or group).

So, **you don’t change the util yet** — you just *read from it* to understand the existing logic.

---

## 🧠 How the Logic Works After Update

Once your column is populated and the logic is integrated:

1. When the **admin edits or creates a template**:

   * They’ll see checkboxes (User / City / Vendor).
   * They can select one or more.
   * The frontend will send the selected values as a **comma-separated list** in the request payload (e.g., `"1,2"`).

2. On the **backend**:

   * This value will be saved in the `notify_to` column for that template.
   * If a record already exists, the backend will fetch the existing value, combine it with any new ones if necessary, and then update the final combined value.

3. When the **API returns data** (for display in UI):

   * The same comma-separated value (`"1,2"`) will be sent back.
   * The UI will split it and check the corresponding checkboxes (User and City).

4. Later, when the system needs to **actually send an email**, another upcoming story will handle it.

   * That story will read the value from `notify_to`.
   * Based on that, it will determine the actual recipients (user, city, vendor, or all).

Right now, your story is **only about storing and maintaining this configuration** — not about sending emails.

## 📋 Your Specific Responsibilities (Now)

Here’s your clear list of next actions:

1. **Review the existing notification util**

   * Find how the system currently decides who receives emails.
   * Make a note of which templates or workflows go to User, City, or Vendor.

2. **Finalize the default mapping**

   * For each workflow/template, decide which recipients apply.
   * Write those mappings clearly — for example:

     * Template A → User only
     * Template B → City and Vendor
     * Template C → All three

3. **Prepare and run the update queries**

   * Update the `notify_to` column in your database with those default values.
   * Each query updates a group of templates based on the workflow they belong to.

4. **Update the backend logic**

   * Ensure that whenever a template is created or updated, the value passed from the UI (`notify_to`) is saved correctly.
   * When fetching data, ensure the same value is returned so the UI can show selected checkboxes.

5. **Test the flow**

   * Create/update templates.
   * Verify that the correct comma-separated values are being stored in `notify_to`.
   * Check that these values are visible in the response and reflected properly in the UI.

## 🔮 What Will Happen Later (For Context)

There will be another story after yours:

* That story will make use of your `notify_to` column.
* When a notification is triggered, it will read the stored value and send emails to the right recipients.
* So your current work forms the **foundation** for that logic.

Would you like me to help you write a **final mapping plan** (a clear table of what values should be set for which templates) before you write your update queries?
That’s usually the step done next after this clarification.
