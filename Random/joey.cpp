Absolutely — here’s a clear, structured explanation of what that discussion means in simple, professional terms:

---

### **Context**

There’s a system that sends notifications (emails, alerts, etc.).
The field **`notifyTo`** determines **who should be notified** for a particular email template.

There are **three possible recipients (use cases):**

1. **User** → ID = `1`
2. **City** → ID = `2`
3. **Vendor** → ID = `3`

These three values will be defined as **constants or enums** (to avoid magic numbers).

---

### **How the `notifyTo` Field Works**

* The `notifyTo` field in the **database** will **store these values as a comma-separated string**, e.g.
  `"1,2"` → means notifications go to **User and City**.
  `"1,3"` → means **User and Vendor**.

---

### **Frontend (l’s Part)**

* When the page loads (e.g., Edit Email Template):

  * Fetch the **existing record** from the database.
  * Get the current value of `notifyTo` (e.g., `"1,3"`).
  * **Split the string by commas** and **pre-check** the corresponding checkboxes (User, City, Vendor).

* When updating:

  * Based on which checkboxes are selected,
  * **Form a comma-separated string** again (e.g., `"1,2"`),
  * And send this string in the **payload** (request body) to the backend.

---

### **Backend (Vikas’ Part)**

* On update:

  1. **Fetch the existing record** from the DB.
  2. Get the current `notifyTo` value (comma-separated IDs).
  3. Combine it properly with the **new value** from the payload (if needed).
  4. Update the DB with the **new comma-separated string**.

* The backend doesn’t yet need to trigger any notifications —
  That part will come **later** in another story/ticket, where logic will be added to determine recipients when an actual notification is triggered.

### **Summary**

| Component       | Task                                                                   |
| --------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Constants**   | Define: `USER = 1`, `CITY = 2`, `VENDOR = 3`                           |
| **Frontend**    | Show checkboxes, send comma-separated values (e.g., `"1,3"`)           |
| **Backend**     | Save comma-separated values in DB, handle update logic                 |
| **Future Work** | Notification trigger logic to use `notifyTo` values to find recipients |

Would you like me to rewrite this as a **concise documentation-style summary** (for a Jira story or Confluence page)? It’ll make it easy to share with your team.
